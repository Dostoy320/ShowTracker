#ShowTracker
This app tracks your progress through the seasons of televisions shows. The idea
originally came to me after I downloaded all **110** episodes of Northern Exposure and 
struggled to keep track of my progress because I watched episodes often weeks, and sometimes months, apart.
For a while I just maintained a txt file, but I figured there had to be a better 
way.

The app uses the [The Movie Database](http://www.themoviedb.org/) API to retrieve
the data for a given show.

###Development-level stuff:

####Database creation:
+ from /showtracker/: `python db_create.py`

####Work with the API in the python shell:
+ `from api_parser import MovieDatabase`
+ Initialize session: `sess = MovieDatabase()`
+ Use methods: 
    + `search()`: takes string query to locate show ID on TMDB
    + `retrieve()`: takes the show ID to gather specifics such as number of seasons
    + `seasons()`: takes the show ID and a season number and returns episodes
+ Example case:
    + `sess = MovieDatabase`
    + `show = sess.search('northern exposure')`
    + `show = sess.retrieve(4396)`
    + `season1 = sess.seasons(4396, 1)`
+ Pretty Print is nice for reading the results: `from pprint import pprint`
    + `pprint(NE1)`


####ToDo:
+ Fix signup validation to halt duplicate usernames
+ Tie users to specific shows - *This is huge. Figure it out!*
+ Stop neglecting tests
+ Develop an environment where users can manipulate/delete shows/seasons/episodes
+ Check for existing show in database before adding duplicate
+ Enable logging (to email?)
+ Work on styling with priority on mobile
